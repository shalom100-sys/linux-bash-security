# Base-02 – Authentication Logic & Conditionals
# Personal Notes

## Goal
Understanding basic authentication logic using conditionals.
Learning how user input is handled and validated in Bash scripts.

---

## Variables
USER_OK / PASS_OK
Used to store the expected credentials.
Separating configuration from logic improves readability and control.

---

## read
Used to receive user input from stdin.

read username
Reads visible input.

read -s password
Reads input silently (used for passwords).

---

## if statement
Used to evaluate conditions and control execution flow.

#-Example:
if [ "$username" = "$USER_OK" ]; then
    ...
fi

---

## Logical AND ( && )
Used to ensure multiple conditions are true.

Example:
[ "$username" = "$USER_OK" ] && [ "$password" = "$PASS_OK" ]

Both conditions must evaluate to true for successful authentication.

---

## exit
Used to terminate script execution.

exit 0
Successful execution.

exit 1
Failure or invalid condition.

---

## Security Notes
- Password input should never be echoed to the screen.
- Hardcoded credentials are for learning purposes only.
- Repeating authentication attempts without control is dangerous.
- Automation and attempt limiting belong to the next stage.

---

## Summary
#-This stage focuses on:
- Conditional logic
- Input validation
- Basic authentication flow
Without loops or automation.
