# Base 04 – Controlled Authentication Flow

This module focuses on building a controlled authentication process
using loops and functions in Bash.

Instead of relying on linear scripts,
this stage introduces structured flow control:

- Limited authentication attempts
- Clear separation between validation logic and decision-making
- Automated handling of success and failure states

The loop functions as an attempt controller,
while validation logic is isolated into dedicated functions.

This design improves readability, security awareness,
and prepares the mindset required for lower-level programming
and exploit development.
