# base-01 : Linux Command-Line Fundamentals for Security Work

This module establishes core Linux command-line foundations with a
security-oriented mindset.  
The focus is on navigation, environment awareness, and safe inspection
of files and directories as preparation for later enumeration and
offensive security tasks.

## Capabilities & Tools

- **Navigation & Environment Awareness**  
  Using `pwd`, `ls -la`, and `cd` to understand the system hierarchy and
  identify relevant directories, including hidden files and configuration paths.

- **File and Directory Handling**  
  Creating directories and files with `mkdir` and `touch` to understand
  structure, staging, and basic file system interactions.

- **Safe File Inspection**  
  Reading files with `cat`, `less`, `head`, and `tail` to inspect logs and
  configuration files while maintaining control and avoiding unnecessary
  output or resource usage.

## Operational Goals

1. **Orientation:**  
   Always knowing where we are in the file system and how we got there.

2. **Information Awareness:**  
   Identifying potentially interesting files and directories through careful inspection.

3. **Security Mindset:**  
   Developing habits that prioritize visibility, caution, and accuracy
   when interacting with a live system.

> This module serves as a foundation layer for later stages such as system
> enumeration, privilege escalation, and persistence.
