## Base 04 – Internal Logic Notes

### General Overview

In this stage, the authentication process is controlled by a loop
rather than manual repetition.

The loop is not just a repetition mechanism.
It acts as an attempt limiter and flow controller.

The script is structured around three logical layers:

1. Threshold Conditions (Entry Conditions)  
2. Validation Functions  
3. Control Loop

This separation creates clarity, control, and security-oriented logic.

## Control Flow Explanation

The loop enforces system policy:
- How many attempts are allowed
- When execution should continue
- When access should be granted
- When access should be blocked

Validation logic is isolated into functions.
These functions do not print output or make decisions.
They only return logical results.

The main control flow evaluates these results
and applies system-level decisions accordingly.

This structure mirrors real authentication systems
and prepares for lower-level programming languages such as C.

## Commands Used in This Module

### while
Used to implement the attempt-limiting loop.
Controls how many authentication attempts are allowed before blocking access.

### return
Used inside validation functions.
Returns a logical status:
- `0` for success
- `1` for failure  
Does not produce output.

### exit
Used by the main control flow.
Terminates script execution after a final decision is made.

### read / read -s
Used to collect user input.
The `-s` flag prevents password disclosure during input.

### sleep
Introduces a delay between failed attempts.
Acts as a basic defense against rapid brute-force behavior
and enforces controlled execution timing.

## Design Principles Learned

- Functions report status, they do not decide
- The loop enforces policy, not validation
- The main flow acts as an entry gate to the system
- Security logic is enforced automatically, not manually

This approach improves readability, maintainability,
and security awareness in scripting.
