This module introduces conditional logic and decision-making in Bash.
The focus is on authentication-style checks, error handling, and
understanding how programs decide success or failure.

## Topics Covered
- Variables and user input
- if / else conditionals

## Security Mindset
Understanding how systems validate input and handle failure
is critical for later vulnerability research and exploit development.
