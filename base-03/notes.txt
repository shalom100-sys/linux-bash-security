Base-03 Notes

Goal:
Move from single-check logic to controlled repeated execution.

Key ideas learned:

1. Loops (while)
A while loop allows code to run repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
This is used to:
- Allow multiple login attempts
- Control program flow over time

Structure:
while [ condition ]; do
  commands
done

2. Attempts counter
The variable "attempts" tracks how many times the user failed.
It represents system state.

Example:
attempts=0
MAX_ATTEMPTS=3

Each failed login increases attempts by 1.

3. Exit codes
exit 0  -> success
exit 1  -> failure

Exit codes allow scripts to communicate results to the system
or to other scripts.

4. State and control
The script makes decisions based on current state:
- attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS  -> allow retry
- attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS -> block user

This logic is similar to real authentication systems.

5. Security perspective
Rate limiting and attempt control are critical security mechanisms.
Understanding them helps identify weaknesses in poorly implemented systems.
